Messenger with ASP.NET+GraphQL(Hot Chocolate v13) and React.js as frontend
This project was inspired by Telegram. The main goal of this project was using GraphQL with ASP.NET for interaction with client side using REST
as well as real-time messaging. Authorization and authentication are placed on a separate server with Keycloak (based on OpenID Connect)
Frontend is a prototype of web-messanger on  React.All client requests are cached using Apollo Client.
